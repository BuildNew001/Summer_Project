## :rocket: Getting Started (Local Setup)

To set up Codeblaze locally for development or testing, follow these detailed steps. Ensure you have Node.js, npm, Docker (if using for judge), and Git installed on your system.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning the Codeblaze repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/BuildNew001/codeblaze.git](https://github.com/your-username/codeblaze.git)
cd codeblaze
```
### 2.Install Dependencies & Configure Environment Variables
Navigate into backend , complier and  frontend directories to install dependencies. Create .env files in both directories and add necessary environment variables (e.g., MongoDB connection string, AWS credentials, backend URL).
```bash
# In backend directory
npm install
# Create backend/.env with your config
# In complier directory
npm install
# Create complier/.env with your config
# In frontend directory
npm install
# Create frontend/.env with your config (e.g., REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:1000)
```
### 3.Start the Servers
```bash
# In the backend directory
node server.js
# In a new terminal, in the complier directory
node server.js
# In a new terminal, in the frontend directory
npm run dev
```
